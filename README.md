# My-Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio page that prospective hiring partners or businesses can use to assess my skills as a software engineer, and can then be more informed in their decision to hire me as an employee. Anyone can also use it to see if they would like to collaborate with me on a project whether or not that project is employment based. This is also a good place for me to have all my projects gathered and others can use it as a resource to look back on my projects if they need to know how I accomplished a task or how I made a line of code work.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this webpage you can start by selecting one of the selections on the Nav bar. Each selection will contain information about me, selections for my work, my contact info, or my resume. You can move to one of these sections from the top of the page by using the nav bar and clicking on one of the titles, which will take you to the corresponding element in the page. We then can use these sections to reference different aspects of my employability whether that be my selection of work or my professional resume. 

## Credits

Pulled README from Pre-Work-Study-Guide in my own repositories.
Used activity code from gitlab repository to reference best practices for styling CSS along with how to make sure each section grew in proper porportion to each other. Also used the same git lab repository codes to look at how different styliings would affect my webpage so that the webpage could look as professional as possible (at least for a first try after 2 weeks of learning). Used MDN as a resource to understand how to set a filter that could be removed with the hover effect. Also used MDN as a reference for some of the more complex spacing and alignment issues I ran into while trying to keep the labels on the images and keep those images and labels in good spacing without compromising other aspects of the webpage.
I pulled my non self images from these sites:
